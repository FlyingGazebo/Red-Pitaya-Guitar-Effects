WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2455 - Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 <i_daisy/i_tx/i_oserdese>. This can
   result in corrupted data. The CLK / CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or
   by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide
   for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
