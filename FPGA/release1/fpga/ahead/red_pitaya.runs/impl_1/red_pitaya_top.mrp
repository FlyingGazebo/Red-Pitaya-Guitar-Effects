  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

WARNING:Pack:2949 - The I/O component adc_clk_p_i uses an DQS_BIAS attribute

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net i_guitar/i_dist/unnorm[31]_unnorm[30]_MUX_1093_o is sourced by a

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2455 - Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 <i_daisy/i_tx/i_oserdese>. This can
   result in corrupted data. The CLK / CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or
   by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide
   for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 272 block(s) removed
 102 block(s) optimized away
1525 signal(s) removed
 146 Block(s) redundant

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.

* Slices can be packed with basic elements from multiple hierarchies.
  Therefore, a slice will be counted in every hierarchical module
  that each of its packed basic elements belong to.
** For each column, there are two numbers reported <A>/<B>.
   <A> is the number of elements that belong to that specific hierarchical module.
   <B> is the total number of elements from that hierarchical module and any lower level
   hierarchical modules below.
*** The LUTRAM column counts all LUTs used as memory including RAM, ROM, and shift registers.
