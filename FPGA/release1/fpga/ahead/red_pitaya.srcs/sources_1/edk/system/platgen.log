Computing clock values...
INFO:EDK:1432 - Frequency for Top-Level Input Clock
   'processing_system7_0_PS_CLK_pin' is not specified. Clock DRCs will not be
   performed for IPs connected to that clock port, unless they are connected
   through the clock generator IP.

   'processing_system7_0_M_AXI_GP0_ACLK_pin' is not specified. Clock DRCs will
   not be performed for IPs connected to that clock port, unless they are
   connected through the clock generator IP.

Running DRC Tcl procedures for OPTION IPLEVEL_DRC_PROC...
INFO:EDK - INFO: DDR Base and High address in current configuration is
   0x00000000 and 0x1FFFFFFF respectively. 
INFO:EDK - INFO: You can modify the DDR address range accessed by Programmable
   Logic through the processing_system7 AXI slave interfaces. If MicroBlaze is a
   master on processing_system7 AXI slave interfaces, please use the top half of
   the address range (Base Address = 0x10000000; High Address = 0x1FFFFFFF). For
   all other master, any subset of the DDR address can be used. See Xilinx
   Answer 47167 for more information. 
Address Map for Processor processing_system7_0
WARNING:EDK:4123 - IPNAME: processing_system7, INSTANCE: processing_system7_0,
   PARAMETER: C_DDR_RAM_BASEADDR - ASSIGNMENT=CONSTANT is defined in the MPD.
   Its value should not be overwritten in the MHS.
