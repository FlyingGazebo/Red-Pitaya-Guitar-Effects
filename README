Red Pitaya Ecosystem and Applications 

Here you will find the sources of various software components of the
Red Pitaya system. The components are mainly contained in dedicated
directories, however, due to the nature of the Xilinx SoC "All 
Programmable" paradigm and the way several components are interrelated,
some components might be spread across many directories or found at
different places one would expect.
